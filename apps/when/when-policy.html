        <h1>When App Privacy Policy</h1>

        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
            Allan Davis built the When? app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Allan Davis at no 
            cost and is intended for use as is.
        </p> <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure 
            of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
        </p> <p>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in 
            relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and 
            improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described 
            in this Privacy Policy.
        </p> <p>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, 
            which are accessible at When? unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

        </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
            For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain 
            personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your 
            device and is not collected by me in any way.

        </p> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
            I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect 
            data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
            include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system 
            version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the 
            Service, and other statistics.

        </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. 
            These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal 
            memory.
        </p> <p>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.

        </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
            I do not employ third-party companies and individuals.

        </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or 
            method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed 
            to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you 
            to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for 
            the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

        </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <div><p>
            I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children 
            to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I 
            encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce 
            this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through 
            the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has 
            provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact 
            us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable 
            information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

        </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
             I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically 
             for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-01-26</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
          
        <p>For any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto: viktorevil@icloud.com">contact me</a> directly.</p>
