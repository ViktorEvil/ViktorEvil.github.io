        <h1>When App Privacy Policy</h1>

        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
        <p>
            When? is an app developed and maintained by one developer. As the developer of When? I care and respect your
            privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
            of Personal Information if you decide to use the When? app.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to use the When? app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
            relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
            in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions,
            which are accessible at <a href="/apps/when/when-terms.html">Terms &amp, Conditions</a> unless otherwise
            defined in this Privacy Policy.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
        <p>
            The When? app does not collect any personally identifiable information.

            When? will ask for permission to see your current location, this is used by When? solely to display a map of
            your
            current location. This personally identifiable information never leaves your device.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
            These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
            memory. When? does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>
            I do not employ any third-party companies or individuals.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
            Remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure
            and
            reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>
            The map portion of When? may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
            directed
            to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you
            to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for
            the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

        </p>
        </div>

            for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
